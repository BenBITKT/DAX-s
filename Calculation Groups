-- Calculation Groups are a way to organise measures in a matrix table
-- Normally in matrix tables, power bi will sort the columns like:

--Jan 24            Feb 24             Mar 24
--Quantity    Sales Quantity    Sales  Quantity    Sales

-- Calculaton groups are a way to apply parameters across a number of measures without having to create numerous seperate measures. The term '=SELECECTMEASURE' is used to apply whatever conditions 
-- needed to all measures eg on BISON the measures are 'Buy_In_Qty' and 'Sell_Out_Qty'. The conditions applied are quantitys for all years, then previous year quantity and also a variance. 
-- Theses conditions are applied both measures

-- First step is to tell power bi to use 'calculation groups' (this step is not required on latest verisons of power bi)

-- Open the desktop app and go to 'File \ Options and settings \ Options \ Preview features' and tick the box that says 'Model explorer and Calculation group authoring'. Click 'Ok' and then restart the desktop app
-- Open the desktop app and go to 'Model view' (the icon of the three boxes). Under 'Data \ Model' Click on 'Calculation groups' and select 'Add' then give the group a name eg 'Metrics'

-- This process will add a table with the name provided
-- Calculation groups will only apply to calculated measures. So whatever needs to be in the table will need transferring from an implict measure to a calculated measure. Eg Qty = SUM(... QUANTITY)

-- In the table will be a 'Calculation item' defaulted with the calculation '= SELECTEDMEASURE'. Change this to the calculation required eg Qty
-- Add new items for each measure required eg sales, profit average selling price

-- Go back to 'Report view' and the new group will be in a seperate table. Drag the group into the 'Columns' field on the visualizations pane then drag in one of the measures eg 'Qty'

-- We can also create a Calculation Group to add totals for the period, same period has last year and a Growth percentage

-- Below are the Calculation Groups used for the Sailun Dealership. This report has two measures (Qty & T/O) split by month. There are calculation group to show the measures by month. 

Quantity - Qty = [Qty]
Turnover - TO = [TO]

Then there
-- is another calculation group to show the KPI's (Period, PY and Growth%)

Period = FORMAT( SELECTEDMEASURE(), "#,##0")

-- Change the Calculation item to Period and leave the calculuation as 'Period = SELECTEDMEASE()'

-- For the same period as last year add a new calculation item and use this calc:

Period - 
LY = 
 IF(
    NOT ( ISINSCOPE('Sailun Dealerships'[Month])),
        CALCULATE(
            SELECTEDMEASURE(),
            SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Sailun Dealerships'[INVDATE].[Date])
        )
 )

Previous Year - 
PY = 
  IF(
    NOT ( ISINSCOPE('Dealerships Query'[Month])),
       CALCULATE(
            FORMAT( SELECTEDMEASURE(), "#,##0"),
            SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Dealerships Query'[INVDATE].[Date])
       )   
 )

Growth% - 
Growth% = 
VAR CY = SELECTEDMEASURE()
VAR LY = 
    CALCULATE(
        SELECTEDMEASURE(),
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR( 'Dealerships Query'[INVDATE].[Date])
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        CY && LY && NOT ( ISINSCOPE('Dealerships Query'[Month])),
       FORMAT( DIVIDE( CY, LY ) - 1, "percent"))


-- If using two calculaiton groups remember to stack then as Metrics, KPI's and Month Name in the 'Columns' pane

-- Another example of a calculation group is from BISON

-- The measures are 'Qty_Buy_In', Qty_Sell_Out' and the same but for weights. 

-- The conditional calcs are:

Period - 
Period = SELECTEDMEASURE()

PY - 
PY = 
CALCULATE(
   SELECTEDMEASURE(),
   DATEADD ('Date'[Date].[Date], -1, YEAR)
)

Variance - 
Var = 
SELECTEDMEASURE() -

CALCULATE(
   SELECTEDMEASURE(),
   DATEADD ('Date'[Date].[Date], -1, YEAR)
)

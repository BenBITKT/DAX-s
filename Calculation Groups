-- Calculation Groups are a way to organise measures in a matrix table
-- Normally in metrix tables, power bi will sort the columns like:

--Jan 24            Feb 24             Mar 24
--Quantity    Sales Quantity    Sales  Quantity    Sales

-- First step is to tell power bi to use 'calculation groups'

-- Open the desktop app and go to 'File \ Options and settings \ Options \ Preview features' and tick the box that says 'Model explorer and Calculation group authoring'. Click 'Ok' and then restart the desktop app

-- Open the desktop app and go to 'Model view' (the icon of the three boxes). Under 'Data \ Model' Click on 'Calculation groups' and select 'Add' then give the group a name eg 'Metrics'

-- This process will add a table with the name provided

-- In the table will be a 'Calculation item' defaulted with the calculation '= SELECTEDVALUE'. Change this to the calculation required eg "Quantity = SUM(... QUANTITY)
-- Add new items for each measure required eg sales, profit average selling price

-- Go back to 'Report view' and the new group will be in a seperate table. Drag the group into the 'Columns' field on the visualizations pane
